Lower portions of each pier has minor abrasion along the channel \\nflow line.\\nA86 - Pier Footings Condition  (Good)\\nPier #3 footing is exposed along the upstream side and is in fairly good condition.  Depths vary up to ~2’-0” to the top of \\nfooting along the upstream nose of pier #3.  Pier #4 also has the top of footing exposed and should be considered to be \\ndived. \\nCHANNEL\\n61 - Channel Condition  (6 - Bank is beginning to slump. River control devices and embankment protection have\\nwidespread minor damage. There is minor stream bed movement evident. Debris is restricting the channel slightly.)\\nLamoille River flows mainly through span #4 with remaining spans having smaller portions of flow due to elevation.  \\nChannel bottom is gravel and silty.  Channel banks are well vegetated with good brush and tree growth.  Abutment #2 has \\nstone riprap and sandy material in front for protection while abutment #1 has sand build up in front.  \\nB.C.10 Channel Protection Condition Rating  (GOOD - Some minor defects.)\\nBoth abutments are out of water with having stone and grubbing material.  Piers have little to no protection present.  \\nB.C.11 Scour Condition Rating  (Widespread minor or isolated moderate scour.)\\nPiers have varying levels of scouring present with upstream end of pier #1, pier #3 and pier #4 having moderate scouring.  \\nThe upstream footing along pier #3 and #4 are exposed due to heavier scouring present with depths of up to ~2’-0” on pier \\n#3 to top of footing. \\nTeam Lead: Stephen Piro,  Inspection Date: 09/27/2023\\nStructure #00020 /  (Routine)\\nRoute VT15 /  \\nVT 00015 ML over LAMOILLE RIVER\\nGENERAL OBSERVATION\\nStructure is in fairly good to satisfactory condition.  Both Vermont type joint troughs over pier #1 and #2 are full of debris \\nand sediment with vegetation growth and are in need of cleaning.  Areas of bridge rail have impact damage on the \\nupstream side along the upper tiers of aluminum tear drop rail and along the offsets.  Offsets have areas of gouges and \\nscrapes with some offsets being bent in the direction of traffic (eastern direction).  The upper tiers of rail have areas of \\nlarge gouges, scrapes and even some tearing present.  Due to the flooding in July of 2023 pier #3 has localized scouring \\nalong the upstream end exposing the footing and should see some channel repairs.\\nTeam Lead: Stephen Piro,  Inspection Date:

Both Vermont type joint troughs over pier #1 and #2 are full of debris\\nand sediment with vegetation growth and are in need of cleaning. Areas of bridge rail have impact damage on the\\nupstream side along the upper tiers of aluminum tear drop rail and along the offsets. Offsets have areas of gouges and\\nscrapes with some offsets being bent in the direction of traffic (eastern direction). The upper tiers of rail have areas of\\nlarge gouges, scrapes and even some tearing present. Due to the flooding in July of 2023 pier #3 has localized scouring\\nalong the upstream end exposing the footing and should see some channel repairs.\\n\\nI\\n(\\n(\\n(\\nA\\nB\\nC\\n*\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nE\\tD\\tU\\tT\\tC\\tC\\tC\\tC\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nE\\tD\\tU\\tT\\tC\\tC\\tC\\tC\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nE\\tD\\tU\\tT\\tC\\tC\\tC\\tC\\n2\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n2\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n2\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nE\\tD\\tU\\tT\\tC\\tC\\tC\\tC\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n2\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n2\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n2\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nAsset
