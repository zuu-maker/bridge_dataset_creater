Outer portions of abutment stem / bridge seat \\nhave heavy spalling that has exposed the steel reinforcing below.\\nReinforced concrete abutment #2 is in poor condition having heavy deterioration and decay present scattered throughout.  \\nAbutment stem has heavy spalling along the outer portions that have exposed the steel reinforcing with measurable \\nsection loss.  Bridge seat has heavy spalling along the outer portions that have undermined bearing #1 nearly 80% and \\nbearing #6 nearly 70% and bearing #4 has ~50% undermining due to heavy spalling and pooling water along the bridge \\nseat.\\nA71 - Abutment End Walls Condition  (Poor)\\nReinforced concrete backwalls are in poor condition having heavy concrete spalling / scaling with exposed steel \\nreinforcing near the outer portions of abutments with highly saturated concrete while the interior portions of the backwalls \\nhave some minor cracking with various levels of efflorescence leakage and small rust stains present.\\nA77 - Retaining/Wingwall Condition  (Poor)\\nReinforced concrete wingwalls are in fair condition but are nearing poor condition with progressing deterioration.

Reinforced concrete abutment #1 has minor to moderate cracking scattered \\nthroughout with heavy rust stains and efflorescence leakage along the stem.  Abutment #1 backwall has heavy spalling/ \\nscaling present with highly saturated concrete at both the eastern and western end exposing the steel reinforcing.  Steel \\ntrough over abutment #1 has heavy corrosion and is full of debris allowing debris and leakage to overflow to structure \\nbelow.  Reinforced concrete abutment #2 has heavy spalling along the stem and bridge seat exposing the steel reinforcing \\nwith measurable section loss along the outer portions and multiple areas along the bridge seat with spalling and pooling \\nwater.  Bearings #1, #4 and #6 have severe undermining issues with varying levels of undermining and bearing #1 having \\nthe heaviest deterioration present.  Concrete fascia\\'s have areas of deep concrete scaling / spalling scattered throughout \\n(mainly along the eastern side) with scattered areas of delaminations present along both fascia\\'s and minor cracking and \\nefflorescence leakage along remainder lengths.  Fascia\\'s could be cleaned and patched or have full replacement project \\nto prevent further deterioration.  Deck joints over both abutments have areas of concrete scaling / spalling along the outer \\nportions with curb seals missing or torn and should be repaired or replaced.

Small patched area is\\npresent in the passing lane near abutment #1.\\nA24 - Deck Curb Condition (Fair)\\nConcrete curbing with granite face is in fair condition having areas of minor cracking with moderate to heavy concrete\\nscaling exposing steel reinforcing behind granite blocks. Heaviest scaling and spalling is present along curbing over\\nwingwalls exposing bridge rail anchor bolts and areas surrounding joint areas. Curb seals along the abutment #2 end\\n(North end) are missing allowing heavy leakage to structure below.\\nA36 - Deck Joint Trough Condition (Poor)\\nSteel trough is present at the abutment #1 joint and is in poor condition. Steel trough has heavy section loss with heavy\\nrust scaling and pitting present. Trough is full of debris allowing leakage to structure below.\\nA38 - Deck Drain Condition (Satisfactory)\\nWeep tubes are present along both fascia throughout. Weep tubes have been extended in spans #1 and #3 however #2\\nhas not and are short.\\nA39 - Deck Fascia Condition (Fair)\\n\\nI\\n(\\n(\\n(\\nA\\nB\\nC\\n*\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nE\\tD\\tU\\tT\\tC\\tC\\tC\\tC\\n1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n3\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n8\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nRoute I91 / VT10A\\nStructure #0048N / 0001A(Routine)\\nI 00091 ML over I 91 OVER VT 10A\\nTeam Lead: Stephen Piro, Inspection Date: 04/15/2024\\nConcrete fascia is in fair condition having delaminations and spalling in span #2 on the eastern side of structure.\\nDelaminations and spalling are present over roadway along the eastern side. Various minor to moderate cracking with\\nefflorescence leakage and areas of rust stains are spread throughout eastern fascia where spalling isn\\'t present. Western\\nfascia has lighter deterioration present with having some hairline to light cracking and a few areas of efflorescence\\nleakage and small rust stains.\\nB.C.05 Bridge Railing Condition Rating (SATISFACTORY - Widespread minor or isolated moderate defects.)\\nThree (3) tier aluminum tear drop rail is in fairly good condition having a few small scrapes along the face of rail. Pedestal\\nmounted aluminum posts are in satisfactory condition having small gouges and scrapes below the third tier of rail. Post #2\\nand #3 along the southeast corner of structure away from abutment #1 have exposed anchor bolts due to significant\\nspalling along the curb and fascia.\\nB.C.08 Bridge Joints Condition Rating (FAIR - Some moderate defects.)\\nSteel finger plate joint is present over abutment #1 and is in okay condition having minor to moderate gouges and scrapes\\nalong the top surface of steel in travel lanes with pitting and surface rusting along the shoulders.
